C-Mol recovery showed strong improvement in RS to 5.99% from 3.63%, DS recovery stable at 5%. Sugar quality shows stability with slight improvement in DS purity. Steam consumption remains high versus target. R3 massecuite boiling delayed due to mechanical resource reassignment.",
    "power": "Power generation nearly unchanged at 64.56 LU. Power export stable at 38.41 LU. Aux consumption improved to 8.04%. Turbine PLFs remain healthy above 90% for all units. Steam/fuel ratios stand near targets. Energy saving initiatives realized 0.25% APC reduction due to boiler feed pump optimization.",
