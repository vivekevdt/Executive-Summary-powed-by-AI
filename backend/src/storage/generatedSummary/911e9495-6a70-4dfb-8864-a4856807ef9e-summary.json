    "overall_performance": "The plant demonstrated steady operational performance with marginal improvements in crushing, capacity utilization, and distillery production. Recovery remained stable while losses saw a slight increase, mainly due to molasses. Power generation was stable with slight export decrease. Capex projects are progressing as planned. Operational discipline with 100% plant availability maintained.",
    "benchmark_position": "Compared to peers, the mill’s cane crush on date at 106000 Qtls leads regional averages and peer range on pol in cane and recovery remains competitive at 10.44%. Capacity utilization and power plant PLF showed positive health above targets. Payment and cane supply compared favorably within region.",

Affected cane reduced to 1.6% in yard sampling. Top 10 and bottom 10 indent centers identified with focused action on water logged and dead growers.",
    "engineering": "Engineering showed 99.53% utilization maintaining operational uptime. Downtime increased slightly to 0.47 hrs from 0.16, largely due to feeder drum and cane carrier trippings caused by overloads. Preventive maintenance actions like top roller groove cleaning conducted. Shredder vibration and power metrics stable.",
    "production": "Sugar production steady at 0.64 LQ vs 0.67 LQ last week. Recovery for CH-RS improved to 11.18%, B-Mol recovery DS rose to 6.45%. Quality parameters met targets with minimal losses. Steam and power consumptions steady and within expected ranges.",
    "power": "Power plant operated robustly with 151.3 TPH steam generation and 29.39 MW average turbine load. Boilers and turbine PLF above target levels. Increased sugar plant process power consumption at 29.93% of generation. Aux consumptions stable.",
    "distillery": "Distillery recovered efficiency with ethanol production at 8.33 LL and fermentation efficiency rising to 91.06%. Steam and power consumptions improved, with feedstock quality remaining consistent on syrup. Zero downtime for the week.",
    "quality_ehs": "Total losses slightly increased but within manageable limits. Sugar quality indicators stable with positive trends in ICUMSA. EHS reports showed no accidents and timely resolution of near misses and hazards.",
