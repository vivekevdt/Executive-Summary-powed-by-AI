### 🎯 2. Project Vision & Executive Summary
The **SPE Executive Summary Generator** is a mission-critical AI application designed for **Zuari Industries**. It automates the extraction and comparison of weekly operational data from complex PowerPoint decks, generating decision-ready executive reviews in a standardized, leadership-safe format.

By leveraging **GPT-4o-mini** intelligence, the system identifies performance deltas, equipment efficiencies, and supply chain bottlenecks, presenting them in a professional Word document with zero human calculation error.
